This list is not exhaustive, but gives you an idea of where to look.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Changing how continuous integration (CI) works. The configuration files in <code>.github/workflows</code> are based on the PAM package workflows and rely on the City Modelling Lab's reusable workflows. They will run different levels of tests when pushing new commits and when opening pull requests. You may want to change some of this configuration, e.g., the python versions that tests are run on or whether to notify a slack channel when CI fails/succeeds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adding repository secrets for use in CI. To upload your package to an AWS S3 bucket you will need the secrets <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>, <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>, <code>AWS_S3_CODE_BUCKET</code> available in your repository. You also need secrets for uploading to Anaconda and initiating the Slack notification bot. You can find all the secrets you need for different actions in the City Modelling Lab reusable workflow repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adding logos. The <code>resources</code> directory includes a logo subdirectory that you can add any branding for your package. E.g., <code>resources/logos/title.png</code> will be shown at the top of the README, or you can add a favicon and then link it to your documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Update linting strictness. We use ruff to ensure high code quality. However, it checks only for a subset of possible issues with your code. This is due to existing projects being very difficult to update to meet strict rules. If you are starting a project from scratch, you may like to add more rules for it to check from its extensive list.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorial/#having-problems","title":"Having problems?","text":"<p>Is something not working?</p> <p> Report a bug</p> <p>Missing information in our docs?</p> <p> Report a docs issue</p> <p>Want to submit an idea?</p> <p> Request a change</p> <p>Have a question or need help?</p> <p> Ask a question</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":"<p>All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.</p> <p>The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#unreleased","title":"[Unreleased]","text":"<p>These initial changes are all relative to the original cookiecutter PyPackage repository, of which this is a fork.
